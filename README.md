# Moon Landing Missions Data Analysis Project


# Overview
This README.md provides an overview of a data analysis project focused on Moon landing missions using Power BI. The project involves analyzing a dataset containing information about various Moon landing missions, including Mission, Space Craft, Launching Date, Carrier Rocket, Operator, Mission Status, and Outcome. The dataset has been visualized using Power BI to gain insights and present the findings through various charts and visualizations.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis contains the following columns:

Mission: The name or identifier of the mission.
Space Craft: The name of the spacecraft used for the mission.
Launching Date: The date when the mission was launched.
Carrier Rocket: The type of rocket used to carry out the mission.
Operator: The organization or entity responsible for the mission.
Mission Status: The status of the mission (e.g., successful, failed, ongoing).
Outcome: The specific outcome of the mission.

# Conclusion

This data analysis project using Power BI has allowed us to gain valuable insights into Moon landing missions. By visualizing the dataset, we have explored mission statuses, operator involvement, launch date trends, and mission outcomes. These visualizations provide a clear understanding of the history and outcomes of Moon landing missions.

Feel free to explore the Power BI report for more detailed insights and interactive visualizations.
